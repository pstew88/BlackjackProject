## Lessons Learned

Multiple Inheritances can be a bit confusing to start but towards the end the started to make sense.

The larger a program gets the harder it is for it to "Look pretty" after a certain point you just end up with lots of code, but that doesnt really mean its disorganized.


## How to run

The program runs itself at start. Press 1 to hit or 2 to stay, at the end of your turn the dealer plays his and at the end of theirs a winner is determined.
